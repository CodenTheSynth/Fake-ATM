   # Fake ATM
Fake atm is a little project i did for fun to practice classes.\
you can deposit and withdraw money, convert it into other currencies and back.\
if you want you can add your own currencies into the program. here's a code snippet explaining how:
```
#region HOW TO ADD CUSTOM CURRENCY?
# under the [all currencies availble] comment, there are currencies additional currencies. you can add your own under both.
# example = Currencies.Currency(A, B, C)
# A - How much of this currency is worth a dollar?
# B - The starting amount of the currency.
# C - The Name.
# after finishing, add the currency to the curall list.
```
i hope you enjoy this little thingy :D
